============

An open source financial exchange toolkit from [Furosys Solutions](http://www.furosys.com/).

## Goals
* Facilitate rapid development and deployment of high-performance, scalable exchanges.
* Provide FAST1.2, FIX5.0SP2/FIXT1.1, and JSON-RPC reference gateways.

## Build Dependencies
* Clang 3.2+ and a recent build of libc++
* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) 2.8.x

## Supported Platforms
Development is done on MacOS X Mountain Lion with FreeBSD 10 as the primary deployment target.

Modern Linux distributions should also work, but are relatively untested. 

Windows is unsupported. 

## Build instructions
Coming soon!

## Credits
Enormous thanks to [Object Computing, Inc.](http://www.ociweb.com/) for their excellent, liberally licensed libraries:
